Hello! I am an undergraduate student majoring in Biological Sciences at Sichuan University. I am deeply fascinated by the mysteries of life and evolution, with a particular focus on paleoanthropology and molecular paleontology.

I forked this [template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) to create my personal website, where I hope to share my learning journey, research interests, and occasional thoughts.
